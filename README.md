# Project 10: WTWR.

## Description

WTWR is a project where I created a full-stack application that reads weather data from a Weather API and recomends clothing to the user based on that data.

For the first part of this project I have created and implemented styles to the components that make up for the front end of the app.

This project focuses on the use of Figma, how to optimize images, adding media queries and the practice on how to build a responsive design and handle overflowing text. 


This project uses CRA, HTML, CSS and JS, JSX technologies.
